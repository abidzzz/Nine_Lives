## **Description?**

**Meow!**

Nine Lives is a fast-paced 2D platformer where a cat progresses through a series of short, challenging levels gaining a new ability with each one.

Movement comes first. Then weapons. Then momentum, timing, and control. Every level introduces something new and expects you to use it immediately.

The game is designed to be short, replayable, and skill-focused. Fail fast, retry instantly, and keep moving forward.
